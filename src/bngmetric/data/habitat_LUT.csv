In these situations, do not use the artificial habitat definition. Ensuring condition is as good as or better than originally and still requiring the 10% biodiversity unit gain. If it’s a different sediment type then it will be habitat creation – to be considered natural sediment creation the scheme must meet the natural habitat definition including an aim for biodiversity conservation.

The structures’ designs must maximise likeness to the naturally occurring hard habitats from that area in terms of material (for example geological origin), position (tidal level, exposure, aspect), topographic complexity (surface roughness, availability of microhabitat like rock pools or crevices, slope), to support their colonisation with species naturally occurring in the area and to maximise benefits for biodiversity and ecosystem function. Examples: breakwaters or seawalls built with materials local to the region, and with depressions (rock pools) added during the design process or retrospectively",,No

An open source Python implementation of the UKs Biodiversity Net Gain Metric

## Overview

This project is currently in development. It provides an open source Python implementation of the UK's Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) Metric, a standardized approach to measuring biodiversity impact.

## Implementation

bngmetric is written in JAX to enable more sophisticated analyses in the future, such as gradient-based optimization and uncertainty quantification. However, it's designed to work as a straightforward Python drop-in replacement for existing BNG calculation methods.
